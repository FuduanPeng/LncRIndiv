Description: The relative ordering of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is overall stable in a particular type of normal human tissue but widely disturbed in diseased tissue. Taking this into account, we proposed a method to detect differentially expressed lncRNAs in individual disease samples by utilizing the disrupted ordering in the disease samples.
